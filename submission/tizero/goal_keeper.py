# https://github.com/google-research/football/blob/master/gfootball/doc/observation.md#raw-observations
# into a form easier to work with by humans.
# Following modifications are applied:
# - Action, PlayerRole and GameMode enums are introduced.
# - 'sticky_actions' are turned into a set of active actions (Action enum)
#    see usage example below.
# - 'game_mode' is turned into GameMode enum.
# - 'designated' field is removed, as it always equals to 'active'
#    when a single player is controlled on the team.
# - 'left_team_roles'/'right_team_roles' are turned into PlayerRole enums.
# - Action enum is to be returned by the agent function.
